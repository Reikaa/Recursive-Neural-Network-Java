This repository contains a generic implementation of Simple Recursive Neural Network in java. It uses dl4j and nd4j libraries (version >= 3.6).

### What is this repository for? ###

* Contains implementation of Simple Recursive Neural Network in java
* Version 3.7 dl4j

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the project
* Create a list of trees and set up their leaf-vectors and 
  initialize their gradients.
* Iterator over the training trees and backprop the errors over any loss      
  function of your choice. You can use loss functions in dl4j
* Make prediction on test trees using 
* You can use the Abstract class to define your own composition function for 
  every node. You can define a RNTN or each node can be a neural network 
  itself!
* Currently does not
